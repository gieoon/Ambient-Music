                    The Hideaway has a mid century history as being built by the NZ government c.1947 entirely of native rimu timber. It was initially a minerâ€™s residence and later a home to forestry workers. 

                    Our customers enjoy the luxuries of modern accomodation within a building with deep historical roots.

                    Reefton's Hideaway sits on 9,990m<sup>2</sup> of flat land in the heart of Reefton village (previously known as Quartzopolis, because of its past gold-bearing quartz reefs); Reefton is nestled between the Paparoa Mountains and the Victoria Forest Park incorporating the upper catchment of the sparkly Inangahua river. 
                    You can enjoy cool summer swims in our rivers and skiing in the Lewis Pass. 
                    Neighboured by The Paparoa and Old Ghost Road cycle trails, the Hideaway is frequented by bikers and drivers looking for a place to rest their weary legs. 

                    Our Hideaway is open all year round. It offers very quiet 18 self-contained cottages and a 26-bed lodge. Family friendly for all types of gatherings or retreats. An ideal meeting point between Christchurch and Nelson.
